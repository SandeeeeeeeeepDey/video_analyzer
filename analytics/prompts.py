Answer **only** from the video, in the exact JSON structure below with consistantly accurate timestamp for the Hygiene & Food Safety scopes.

Hygiene & Food Safety
1. **Identify Unhygienic Practices**
   - List any actions that are visibly unhygienic (e.g., touching face/hair/mouth, touching phone then food, using dropped food, sneezing/coughing over food, spitting, barehanded ready-to-eat handling, using bare hands to handle food/food ingredients).
   - Provide exact timestamps for each occurrence.
   - Only describe what is clearly visible — avoid assumptions.

2. **Staff Hygiene Standards**
   - Check if gloves, hairnets, masks, or aprons are worn as required.
   - Verify that raw and cooked food are kept separate.
   - Ensure no food is used after being dropped or improperly stored.

3. **Surface & Utensil Cleanliness**
   - Note if preparation surfaces, knives, spoons, or equipment are visibly clean.
   - Watch for cross-contamination between different food items.

4. **Handwashing Practices**
   - Check if staff wash hands before handling food or after touching non-food surfaces.
   - Add timestamps for both proper and missing handwashing.
